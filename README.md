This is an attempt to use Python 3 tools to analyze data from a 2014 mental health survey. The
ultimate goal is to be able to find indicators that could predict how friendly a particular
workplace might be to someone with a mental illness. 

Current status: Still cleaning up the data. Form validation is important, kids.

(Still trying to decide if I'm going to make blog posts about this. If I do, it'll
be when I'm further along with the project. This is not a class project, and if you copy this
for a class, you'll regret it. So don't do that.)
